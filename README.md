# Driving lanes detection

This repo contains word done on an experiment to track the lane lines in a video feed from a dashboard camera on a car.

Information about the experiment can be found in the [Write-up](./writeup.md)

Instructions on how to replicate the experiment will come in the future once I get time to better document the process.  The code is commented so you are welcome dig in.
